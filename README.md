# Bulk Baconizing

For cases where a large number of records need to be processed using Bacon, this
repository serves as a template to generate the required age files in an organized
fashion.  It provides default parameters for initial runs, and provides a tracking
module to indicate whether any issues were encountered in the construction of the
geochronological table.
