# Parameters Folder and Files

The Parameters file is intended to record the final parameters used in the compilation of a set of Bacon records, and, with the `agg_msg()` function, record any signficant choices in the assignment of chronologies, age models, hiatuses or parameter changes.

The script `run_bacon.R` in the parent directory will assign a version number to the runs.  This can be changed by editing the `settings.yaml` file in the main directory.
